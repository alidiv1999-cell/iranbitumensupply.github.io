           Bitumen 80/100:
           This softer grade bitumen provides greater flexibility, which helps prevent cracking in colder climates. It is often used in regions with low temperatures and lighter traffic loads, making it suitable for city roads and residential areas.

              Bitumen 40/50:
              This is a hard grade bitumen with low penetration, making it ideal for use in hot climates and heavy-duty applications. It provides excellent resistance to deformation and is commonly used in highways, airport runways, and industrial paving projects.

               <p>
                 Performance Grade (PG) Bitumen: PG grades are classified under the Superpave system and designed to perform under specific temperature ranges. For example, PG 64-22 works well up to 64°C and down to -22°C. These grades are tailored to climate and traffic conditions, ensuring long-lasting pavement performance and reliability in advanced engineering projects.
