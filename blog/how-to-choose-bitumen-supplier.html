  <h1>How to Choose a Reliable Bitumen Supplier from Iran</h1>

  <p class="blog-intro">
    Selecting the right Iranian bitumen supplier is a critical decision for
    infrastructure contractors, importers, and government buyers.
    Beyond price, buyers must evaluate quality consistency, refinery sourcing,
    export documentation, and logistical reliability to avoid costly delays
    and compliance issues.

  <h2>1. Verify Refinery-Direct Supply</h2>
  <p>
    Reliable Iranian bitumen exporters operate with direct refinery access.
    This ensures consistent penetration values, controlled production batches,
    and stable long-term availability.
    Traders without refinery linkage often depend on fluctuating stock,
    increasing the risk of specification deviation.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Demand Complete Export Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    Professional bitumen exporters provide full documentation for every shipment.
    This typically includes Certificate of Analysis (COA), MSDS, packing list,
    bill of lading, and optional third-party inspection reports such as SGS.
    Buyers should confirm documentation standards before issuing payment terms.

  <h2>3. Understand Which Bitumen Type Fits Your Project</h2>
  <p>
    Different infrastructure projects require different bitumen specifications.
    Road construction, waterproofing, airport runways, and industrial coatings
    all demand distinct performance characteristics.
  </p>


  <h2>4. Evaluate Export Experience and Market Coverage</h2>
  <p>
    Experienced Iranian exporters understand regional buyer requirements in
    India, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.
    This includes packaging preferences, climate conditions,
    and port-specific logistics that directly impact shipment success.

  <h2>5. Price Transparency and Long-Term Supply Stability</h2>
  <p>
    Bitumen pricing is influenced by crude oil markets, grade specifications,
    packaging type, and destination port.
    Reputable suppliers provide transparent quotations and support repeat supply
    rather than opportunistic spot pricing.
